      <div class="container">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Advocare is a mobile app designed for users who experience chronic health problems.
        Navigating the health care system and tracking illness progression can be exhausting, but is often necessary for users with chronic health conditions. For many who are already debilitated by their health problems, this can take a huge toll on their already limited energy; physically, mentally and emotionally.
        </p>
        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>I designed Advocare, taking the role of Product Designer/UX Designer. This project was created for Career Foundry's UX Immersion course.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>

          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>Users with Chronic Health Conditions need a way to better advocate for themselves when accessing health care because their ability to communicate with their care providers is compromised by:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>the energy needed to manage their current symptoms and treatment, and;</li>
            <li>systemic barriers within the healthcare system</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <h4>Visit Tracker</h4>
            <p>A tool for users to log upcoming and past visits with doctors, specialists, therapists, and other health care providers. Users can also store location and contact information for their providers, making it all accessible in one place.
            </p>
            <h4>Visit Prep</h4>
            <p>The ability to create a Visit Plan, where users can prepare for doctor appointments by preparing a list of questions and discussion points in advance. Users can set goals for the visit to ensure they make the most of their time with their provider.
              </p>
            <h4>Visit Summary</h4>
            <p>A tool for users to record how their visit went. Users can confirm which of their visit goals were met, and record important notes from what was discussed. They can also use this tool to keep track of treatment changes made.

            <h3>Dashboard</h3>
            <p>Early iterations included pages called Feedboards, which served as a Dashboard for a specific health condition the user is tracking. Users would have one per condition they track.  
              As I streamlined my design, I realized this created a navigation experience that was convoluted.
              As the design progressed I switched to a single dedicated Dashboard that would include information relevant to all conditions the user is tracking.</p>

            <h3>Care Visits</h3>
            <p>Early iterations had one section of the app called Care. This section featured three sub sections: Care Visits, Care Team, and Care Clinics.
              I later re-organized my information architecture in order to streamline the UX. All information pertaining to Care Clinics is found on Care Provider profile pages. The Care Team subsection is now a child of the more generalized Visits parent section.  
              Visits that occurred in the past are now viewed by tapping the Visit History link, which helped trim down the excess of information on this page.</p>
